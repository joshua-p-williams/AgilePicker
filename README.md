# AgilePicker

A simple .net core c# application to present a questionnaire the help a team decide if they are better suited for Scrum or Kanban.

This is a simple survey, and it's not robust.  It was just a simple attempt at a quick little survey to ask a few questions to try to get people to answer blindly without known bias and give a systematic decision map to help explore which agile methodology might fit a particular team or work center.

It will ask you questions and give a summary showing a recommendation and why it's making the recommendation.
